### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics decussed in class in general gave me a rough idea of what the assignment was.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If i had more time , I could have effectively added more style to me project and may increased its funtionality.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I released my peers relied a lot in css and had a better control of the syntax and functionality so in the end their product came out much more styled and attractive
